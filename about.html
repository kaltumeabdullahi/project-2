          <p>Welcome to a place where flavor meets feeling.</p>
          <p>
            We’re not just about food — we’re about the moments it creates. The
            first bite that makes you smile. The aroma that reminds you of home.
            The plate that brings people together.

          <p>
            At <span>Munch'n'Glaze</span>, every meal is a celebration. Whether
            it’s a comforting classic, a sweet indulgence, or something bold and
            new, we serve it with heart, soul, and a side of happiness. Born
            from a love for delicious food and beautiful presentation, our
            kitchen is where passion stirs the pot, and creativity spices things

          🍴 1. A Personal Touch (founder’s voice) <br />
          I started this journey with nothing but a passion for good food and a
          big dream. What began as a simple craving has now become a space where
          every dish tells a story — mine, yours, and ours.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          👩🏽‍🍳 2. What Makes Us Different <br />
          We don’t just cook — we curate experiences. Every plate is carefully
          prepared with attention to taste, presentation, and the feeling it
          brings. Quality ingredients, honest recipes, and creative flair —
          that’s our secret.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          🌍 3. Our Mission <br />
          Our mission is simple: to serve food that warms the heart, sparks
          memories, and keeps you coming back for more. Whether it’s a casual
          bite or a full feast, we make every meal feel special.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          ❤️ 4. What We Believe <br />
          We believe food is more than nourishment — it’s connection, culture,
          comfort, and celebration. It brings people together, and that’s
          exactly what we hope to do — one dish at a time.
